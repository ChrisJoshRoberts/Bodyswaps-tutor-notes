                <p class="about-para">Bodyswaps’ VR simulations are a great way to develop and practise public speaking and presentation skills. But to help learners make the most of these opportunities, we have created some offline exercises for them to complete <strong>before they put their headset on.</strong> <br><br>

                    Ideally, learners should complete these exercises a day or two before starting the simulation to have sufficient time to reflect on what they discover. <br><br>
                    
                    If learners aren’t able to complete these exercises beforehand, they can still benefit from taking a few minutes to think about them just before they start the relevant activity in VR. <br><br>
                    
                    Once learners have completed an activity, the best way to boost learning outcomes and maximise chances of success is by practising what they have learned - a lot! <br><br>
                    
                    We have also suggested some exercises they can do <strong>once they take the headset off</strong> to extend the benefits of the training. <br><br>
                    
                    This document collates the offline exercises in relation to each individual activity. <br><br>
                     
                    Learners can do these exercises alone or in discussion with others. It may help them to keep notes on these activities.

                <p class="ex-para">Anxiety is a natural instinct designed to guide you away from dangerous situations. But we often experience it at times when no real danger is imminent. <br><br>

Think about a time that made you anxious - standing up to speak in front of an audience, raising your hand in a big meeting, or even walking through a room full of strangers. Did your anxiety help you or did it hold you back? 
<br><br>
                    Before you start the activity in VR, <strong>take a moment to reflect on how anxiety limits your potential </strong>and how much more you could achieve if you could just set those thoughts aside for a while and live in the moment. Our grounding activity will show you how.

                <p class="ex-para">If you’re going to give a presentation, you need to have something to speak about! If you haven’t already been given a subject to talk about, spend some time now, thinking about what topic you’ll choose. <br><br>

                    <li>Why should your audience be interested? </li>
                    <li>What do you want your audience to know,  feel and do as a result of your speech?</li>

                    Finally, choose one major idea to talk about and summarise it in a single sentence. If you can’t easily summarise it, your speech is too complex. Simplify it and then write it down. <br><br>

                    When you come to planning your speech in more detail, you can use this idea statement to keep your speech on track.

                    When you can calm your mind and focus on the present without needing to go all the way through the countdown from 5 to 1, you’re on your way to becoming a zen master!

                <p class="ex-para">In the training, we looked at the importance of being authentic and explored whether your natural speaking style was a Teacher, Motivator, Expert or Influencer. The point of the exercise wasn’t to pigeonhole you or put you in a box. It was to help you to think about your interests and motivations, so that you can incorporate them into your speeches. <br><br>

                    In reality, we’re rarely one thing or another - we’re somewhere in-between. Choose a pair where you feel no strong preference for one or the other. Now, for your subject, think about something you really care about and make up a <strong>three- to five-sentence speech</strong> for each of the criteria. <br><br>
                    
                    When you have written them, practise delivering your speeches either in private or as a group activity. Record yourself and as you watch it back, think about which approach you connected with the most. This will be your most authentic and charismatic performance. <br><br>
                    
                    You can repeat this activity with as many other pairs of criteria or subjects as you like. Or you can use this approach as inspiration for generating new speech ideas. <br><br>

Their roots stabilise the soil and take up excess rainfall to prevent soil erosion and flooding. And their respiration improves air quality, reducing atmospheric and noise pollution. They benefit everybody, please spare this tree. <br><br>

                If you’re speaking to <strong>inform</strong>, stick to the facts.

                    <li>End with a call to action - what do you want your audience to do?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="ex-para">
                    If you’re speaking to <strong>influence</strong>, appeal to your audience’s emotions.

                    <li>Begin by identifying a problem that your audience cares about</li>

                    <li>End by saying it again - reframe the problem and solution to drive your point home</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="ex-para">
                    If you’re speaking to <strong>inspire</strong>, tell your audience a story.

                <ul class="ex-para-list">

                    <li>Describe the climax - what was the outcome? What was the point of telling this story?</li>
